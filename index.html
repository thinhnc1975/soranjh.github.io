I currently serve as the Quantum Software Development Manager at <a href="https://www.xanadu.ai/">Xanadu</a>, where
I lead a team of software developers focused on <a href="https://pennylane.ai/">PennyLane</a>, an open-source software
library for quantum computing. Our team supports quantum algorithms and quantum chemistry functionalities within 
PennyLane, with the goal of establishing it as the primary library for research and development in the field. My
academic credentials include a PhD in theoretical chemistry, complemented by postdoctoral experience.
